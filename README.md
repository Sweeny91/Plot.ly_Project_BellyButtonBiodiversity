# Brief Background: 
- In this assignment, an interactive dashboard was built to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/), which cataloged the microbes that colonize human navels.
- The given dataset revealed that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

## Step 1: Plotly

1. The D3 library was used to read in `samples.json`.

2. A Horizontal Bar Chart was createdd with a dropdown menu displaying the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.
* Used `sample_values` as the values for the bar chart.
* Used `otu_ids` as the labels for the bar chart.
* Used `otu_labels` as the hovertext for the chart.

3. Created a bubble chart that displays each sample.
* Used `otu_ids` for the x values.
* Used `sample_values` for the y values.
* Used `sample_values` for the marker size.
* Used `otu_ids` for the marker colors.
* Used `otu_labels` for the text values.

4. Displayed the sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information.

5. Displayed each key:value pair from the metadata JSON object on the page.

6. Any time that a new sample is selected, the plots will be updated.

An example dashboard is shown below:

## Advanced Challenge Assignment (Optional)

* Adapt the Gauge Chart from <https://plot.ly/javascript/gauge-charts/> to plot the weekly washing frequency of the individual.
* You will need to modify the example gauge code to account for values ranging from 0 through 9.
* Update the chart whenever a new sample is selected.
